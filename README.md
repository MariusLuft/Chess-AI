# ChessAI
A chess AI using python that avoids nonsensical moves. The Youtube tutorial from Eddie Sharick was used as an orientation for the base game. The game is powered by the pygame library. 

## Concepts
The game determines the valid moves that can be made following the conventional chess rules. This requires the calculation of all possible moves. Considering checks requires even more processing. In order for the AI to work efficienty, the game must be built in a way that keeps processing efforts at a minimum. 

Some of these Concepts are: as little function calls and nested loops as possible, Bitmaps for representation and Alpha Beta Pruning for AI descisions.
